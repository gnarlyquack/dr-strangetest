This file lists all tasks required for the next release. Items that might be
desirable for future releases may be listed at the bottom of the file.


Release
-------
-   Review test suite

-   Niggles to test/check:

    -   What happens if we try to tokenize an empty file?

    -   Do we properly handle directories whose name matches against file name
        patterns?

    -   Do we properly handle traversing towards a target that may have a
        potentially ambiguous directory name in the path? E.g., the target is
        in "tests/test_foobar/test_target.php" and the test suite also has the
        directory "tests/test_foo" (which may or may not also include a file
        "test_target.php")

    -   Do we not discover/traverse symbolic links?

    -   Do we handle traversing multiple times to a directory, file, etc. that
        had a setup error?

    -   (Directory) setup errors when there are targets

    -   Running targets that are a directory or a file that is parameterized
        with multiple argument lists, and/or in a directory hierarchy where one
        or more directories in the hierarchy are parameterized with multiple
        argument lists

    -   Error-checking for argument lists:
        -   setup fixtures must either return an iterable or an instance of
            ArgumentLists
        -   each arglist in ArgumentLists must be an iterable

    -   Handling targets that don't match a test pattern

    -   What if all targets are invalid?


Future
------
-   Distribute EasyTest as a single executable (Phar?)

-   Add support for config files(?)

-   Implement additional CLI options(?)
    -   specify a config file
    -   reverse report output

-   diff: Limit number of lines that are reported before and after the
    differing portion of text

-   Implement "loose" diff/variable formatting for "loose" (==) comparisons?

-   Ensure we're UTF-8 conformant
    https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration71.windows-support.php#migration71.windows-support.long-and-utf8-path

-   Add additional verbosity levels? Most of this would only seem to be
    necessary to support testing... :-/
    -   "all" could show passed tests (in addition to skips and output)

-   Allow test functions and function fixtures to be moved into a class and
    "just work"

-   Implement namespace fixtures and allowing tests to be grouped together
    within a file by namespace?

-   Implement test dependencies

-   Implement Context::assert()?

-   Implement individual Context assertions instead of dynamically searching
    for them? Or cache looked-up names for performance?


Wishlist / Someday
------------------
-   Improve diff algorithm
    -   "a high-performance library in multiple languages that manipulates
        plain text"
        https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch

    -   "Utility to do an N-way diff and N-way merge, for N > 2"
        https://github.com/Quuxplusone/difdef

-   Support calling assert() with arbitrary exceptions in PHP >= 7? It's not
    entirely clear what this would even entail: perhaps allow for outputting
    custom types of errors/failures?
