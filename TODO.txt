This file lists all tasks required for the next release. Items that might be
desirable for future releases may be listed at the bottom of the file.


Release
-------
-   Review test suite

-   Niggles to test/check:

    -   What happens if we try to tokenize an empty file?

    -   Do we properly handle directories whose name matches against file name
        patterns?

    -   Do we properly handle traversing towards a target that may have a
        potentially ambiguous directory name in the path? E.g., the target is
        in "tests/test_foobar/test_target.php" and the test suite also has the
        directory "tests/test_foo" (which may or may not also include a file
        "test_target.php")

    -   Do we not discover/traverse symbolic links?

    -   Do we handle traversing multiple times to a directory, file, etc. that
        had a setup error?

    -   (Directory) setup errors when there are targets

    -   Running targets that are a directory or a file that is parameterized
        with multiple argument lists, and/or in a directory hierarchy where one
        or more directories in the hierarchy are parameterized with multiple
        argument lists

    -   Error-checking for argument lists:
        -   setup fixtures must either return an iterable or an instance of
            ArgumentLists
        -   each arglist in ArgumentLists must be an iterable

    -   Handling targets that don't match a test pattern

    -   What if all targets are invalid?

-   Implement additional assertions? Currently EasyTest's test suite only
    uses/needs the assertions already provided by the framework, but
    presumably other assertions would be useful in other contexts

-   Test installing and running via Composer/Packagist

-   When trying to load Composer, only check the path(s) the autoloader would
    be if EasyTest had been installed via Composer(?). I.e., since EasyTest
    itself doesn't require Composer, we (might) never want/need to try loading
    Composer from our own source tree.

-   Handle errors during test file parsing

-   Why does/did this work on my computer?

Future
------
-   Distribute EasyTest as a single executable (Phar?)

-   Add support for config files(?)

-   Implement additional CLI options(?)
    -   specify a config file
    -   reverse report output

-   diff: Limit number of lines that are reported before and after the
    differing portion of text

-   Implement "loose" diff/variable formatting for "loose" (==) comparisons?

-   Ensure we're UTF-8 conformant
    https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration71.windows-support.php#migration71.windows-support.long-and-utf8-path

-   Add additional verbosity levels? Most of this would only seem to be
    necessary to support testing... :-/
    -   "all" could show passed tests (in addition to skips and output)
    -   "debug" could show debug events in addiont to "all"


Wishlist / Someday
------------------
-   Improve diff algorithm
    -   "a high-performance library in multiple languages that manipulates
        plain text"
        https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch

    -   "Utility to do an N-way diff and N-way merge, for N > 2"
        https://github.com/Quuxplusone/difdef

-   Support calling assert() with arbitrary exceptions in PHP >= 7? It's not
    entirely clear what this would even entail: perhaps allow for outputting
    custom types of errors/failures?
