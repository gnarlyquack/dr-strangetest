This file lists all tasks required for the next release. Items that might be
desirable for future releases may be listed at the bottom of the file.


Release
-------
-   Implement subtests

-   Implement test-specific teardown

-   Implement multiple execution of parameterized tests

-   Implement test functions

-   Implement file-level fixtures

-   Review test suite

-   Niggles to test/check:

    -   What happens if we try to tokenize an empty file?

    -   Do we properly handle directories whose name matches against file name
        patterns?

    -   Do we properly handle traversing towards a target that may have a
        potentially ambiguous directory name in the path? E.g., the target is
        in "tests/test_foobar/test_target.php" and the test suite also has the
        directory "tests/test_foo" (which may or may not also include a file
        "test_target.php")

-   Support PHP 5.3(?)
    -   Short array syntax ([]) isn't supported
    -   Closures don't have access to $this

-   Implement additional assertions? Currently EasyTest's test suite only
    uses/needs the assertions already provided by the framework, but
    presumably other assertions would be useful in other contexts

-   Test installing and running via Composer/Packagist

-   When trying to load Composer, only check the path(s) the autoloader would
    be if EasyTest had been installed via Composer(?). I.e., since EasyTest
    itself doesn't require Composer, we (might) never want/need to try loading
    Composer from our own source tree.


Future
------
-   Distribute EasyTest as a single executable (Phar?)

-   Add support for config files(?)

-   Implement additional CLI options(?)
    -   specify a config file
    -   reverse report output
-   Cache results of directory (and file?) discovery

-   diff: Limit number of lines that are reported before and after the
    differing portion of text

-   Implement "loose" diff/variable formatting for "loose" (==) comparisons?

-   Only determine the test root once. Currently, we determine a new root for
    every provided path, which means we could run potentially try to run tests
    from completely unrelated test suites. This could be problematic, e.g., we
    could have name collisions between the test suites.

    -   Fixing this introduces a new niggle: handling an individual path
        that falls outside of the determined root

-   Compress the token-processing loops in _parse_setup and _discover_file?

-   Ensure we're UTF-8 conformant
    https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration71.windows-support.php#migration71.windows-support.long-and-utf8-path

-   Add additional verbosity levels? Most of this would only seem to be
    necessary to support testing... :-/
    -   "all" could show passed tests (in addition to skips and output)
    -   "debug" could show debug events in addiont to "all"


Wishlist / Someday
------------------
-   Improve diff algorithm
    -   "a high-performance library in multiple languages that manipulates
        plain text"
        https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch

    -   "Utility to do an N-way diff and N-way merge, for N > 2"
        https://github.com/Quuxplusone/difdef

-   Support calling assert() with arbitrary exceptions in PHP >= 7? It's not
    entirely clear what this would even entail: perhaps allow for outputting
    custom types of errors/failures?
