This file lists all tasks required for the next release. Items that might be
desirable for future releases may be listed at the bottom of the file.


Release
-------
-   Distribute EasyTest as a single executable (Phar?)

-   Add support for config files(?)

-   Finish implementing CLI argument parsing
    -   Combined short options
    -   Options with arguments
    -   '-' ends option parsing and is included with any remaining arguments
    -   '--' ends option parsing and is excluded from any remaining arguments

-   Implement CLI options
    -   specify a config file(?)
    -   reverse report output
    -   version
    -   help

-   Fix handling of empty strings in diff class

-   Ensure path discovery is OS independent

-   Support PHP >= 5.3(?)

-   Test discovery: For all tests, first check the reporter, then the context,
    then the runner

-   Ensure anonymous classes are properly handled by the file parser
    https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.anonymous.php

-   Ensure we're UTF-8 conformant
    https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration71.windows-support.php#migration71.windows-support.long-and-utf8-path

-   Ensure that an object with numeric properties is properly handled in the
    variable formatter when it's cast to an array
    https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration72.incompatible.php#migration72.incompatible.object-array-casts

-   Run setup and teardown in a common output buffer with their test

-   Improve(?) test report(?)

-   Handle conditionally-defined test cases

-   assert_throws(): provide better diagnostics when an unexpected
    exception is caught

-   When using a message/description for an assertion, consider showing the
    message in addition to, not in place of, the assertion expression

-   assert_equal() and assert_identical(): stop proxying to the error handler

-   Implement assert_preg_match()(?)

-   Test installing and running via Composer/Packagist

-   Show how long test runs take

-   Eliminate Factory class

-   Separate logging and reporting

-   diff: Limit number of lines that are reported before and after the
    differing portion of text

-   Implement "loose" diff/variable formatting for "loose" (==) comparisons?

-   Failure::__toString: bulletproof the check on 'run_test'
    If we execute a passed-in callable that generates a failure (see
    assert_throws), and the callable is a function with an identifier
    (i.e., not an anonymous function), it seems we could potentially call any
    function within easytest and match on it, which could cause us to break
    out of trace generation too early. So we need to match on something that
    we would never expect to execute as part of a test.

-   Make diff output more compact?
    Instead of showing "- expected" and "+ actual" as prefixes to the diff,
    maybe include them as part of the diff, e.g.: "- $expected = x" and
    "+ $actual = y", where 'x' and 'y' is the first line of the diff


Future / Someday(?)
-------------------
-   Implement data generators/subtests

-   Improve diff algorithm
    -   "a high-performance library in multiple languages that manipulates
        plain text"
        https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch

    -   "Utility to do an N-way diff and N-way merge, for N > 2"
        https://github.com/Quuxplusone/difdef

-   Support calling assert() with arbitrary exceptions in PHP >= 7? It's not
    entirely clear what this would even entail: perhaps allow for outputting
    custom types of errors/failures?
