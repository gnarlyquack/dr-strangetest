This file lists all tasks required for the next release. Items that might be
desirable for future releases may be listed at the bottom of the file.


Release
-------
-   Implement test-specific teardown

-   Review test suite

-   Niggles to test/check:

    -   What happens if we try to tokenize an empty file?

    -   Do we properly handle directories whose name matches against file name
        patterns?

    -   Do we properly handle traversing towards a target that may have a
        potentially ambiguous directory name in the path? E.g., the target is
        in "tests/test_foobar/test_target.php" and the test suite also has the
        directory "tests/test_foo" (which may or may not also include a file
        "test_target.php")

    -   Do we not discover/traverse symbolic links?

    -   Do we handle traversing multiple times to a directory, file, etc. that
        had a setup error?

-   Implement additional assertions? Currently EasyTest's test suite only
    uses/needs the assertions already provided by the framework, but
    presumably other assertions would be useful in other contexts

-   Test installing and running via Composer/Packagist

-   When trying to load Composer, only check the path(s) the autoloader would
    be if EasyTest had been installed via Composer(?). I.e., since EasyTest
    itself doesn't require Composer, we (might) never want/need to try loading
    Composer from our own source tree.

-   How to handle a skip in a test function that then errors during teardown?

-   Handle errors during test file parsing

-   Don't use var_export to display output. Maybe just print directly, but it
    would be nice to display something for output that is just whitespace or
    an empty string

-   Error-checking for argument lists:
    -   setup fixtures must either return an iterable or an instance of
        ArgumentLists
    -   each arglist in ArgumentLists must be an iterable

-   Omit namespace when displaying function fixtures, e.g, "setup_function for
    namespace\test_function" instead of "namespace\setup_function for
    namespace\test_function"

-   Compress the token-processing loops in _parse_setup and _discover_file?

-   Cache results of directory (and file?) discovery

-   Why does/did this work on my computer?

Future
------
-   Distribute EasyTest as a single executable (Phar?)

-   Add support for config files(?)

-   Implement additional CLI options(?)
    -   specify a config file
    -   reverse report output

-   diff: Limit number of lines that are reported before and after the
    differing portion of text

-   Implement "loose" diff/variable formatting for "loose" (==) comparisons?

-   Ensure we're UTF-8 conformant
    https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration71.windows-support.php#migration71.windows-support.long-and-utf8-path

-   Add additional verbosity levels? Most of this would only seem to be
    necessary to support testing... :-/
    -   "all" could show passed tests (in addition to skips and output)
    -   "debug" could show debug events in addiont to "all"


Wishlist / Someday
------------------
-   Improve diff algorithm
    -   "a high-performance library in multiple languages that manipulates
        plain text"
        https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch

    -   "Utility to do an N-way diff and N-way merge, for N > 2"
        https://github.com/Quuxplusone/difdef

-   Support calling assert() with arbitrary exceptions in PHP >= 7? It's not
    entirely clear what this would even entail: perhaps allow for outputting
    custom types of errors/failures?
